## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It's me, Oliver. I'm here to build data science projects and to discover the world through data! That has always been my motivation since I left school to study physics. There must be some underlying structure to all of this, right? Anyhow, if not, at least we can have some fun in the process of finding out.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Analytics with the aim to discover the field and get insights into interesting data sets.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project! So, if you are into collaborative learning reach out to me :) 

## My Tech Stack
- Python
- SQL
- Excel
- Tableau
- Rusty skills but still there: C++
